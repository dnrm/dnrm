# I'm Daniel Medina :wave:

My name is Daniel Medina. I am a high school student at Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey. I started my journey as a web developer in January of 2020. During the COVID-19 pandemic I had a lot of free time therefore I was able to really bump up my skills. I started experimenting with all kinds of technologies and projects. As of June 6th 2022 I have made 8 big projects with more to come. I have also done some small projects which can be found in my Github a profile.


I spend my free time listening and composing music, taking photos, sailing, and coding. I also love collecting vinyl records. I currently have a small collection of them, but plan to expand it indefinitely.
