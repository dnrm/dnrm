# About Me üöÄ

Hey there! I'm Daniel, a passionate full-stack developer and high school student at Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey. I specialize in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) with extensive experience in Next.js, and cloud providers like AWS and Vercel.

My coding journey began in January 2020, and during the COVID-19 pandemic, I took advantage of the extra time to rapidly accelerate my development skills. I love exploring new technologies and building projects that solve real-world problems.
