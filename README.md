# Hi! :seedling:

My name is Daniel Medina. I am a high school student at Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey. My areas of expertise include the **MERN** stack, a very strong understanding of Next.js as well as cloud providers like AWS and Vercel. I started my journey as a web developer in January of 2020. During the COVID-19 pandemic I had a lot of free time therefore I was able to really bump up my skills. I started experimenting with all kinds of technologies and projects. You can find all of my projects here in my Github profile.


I spend my free time listening and composing music, taking photos, sailing, and coding. I also love collecting vinyl records. I currently have a small collection of them, but have been getting more and more lately. Check out my collection on my website.

Feel free to check out my website [here](https://medina.dev). 

## My projects ‚≠êÔ∏è
The projects I am most proud of are my personal portfolio website, the Coding Academy Monterrey website, Earth (A project about ecological problems), the Andromeda Coffee website, and the Joyer√≠a Verbena website.
